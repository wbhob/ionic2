# Ionic 2 Has Moved!

You can now find Ionic2's development in the `2.0` branch, within the `ionic` repo: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/


## Issues
Issues that were open have been moved over to [**the main ionic repo**](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/)

If you need to open an issue, please open an issue through our [Ionitron Issues Form](http://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/)

Moving forward we'll have all issues created through our [Ionitron Issues Form](http://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/), and properly label v1 and v2 issues.
